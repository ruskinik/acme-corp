## Hosts

Like Netlify, other dedicated Jamstack hosts provide similar feature sets like branch/ commit previews, automatic continuous integration and deployment, and API creation support and management.

Vercel provides robust support for managing JavaScript and can be an advantage if our website is getting JavaScript-heavy. Cloudflare Pages are built by one of the biggest CDNs on the planet and provide unlimited bandwidth, better performance than most other services, and a well-defined means to create our APIs (with Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Workers KV).

AWS Amplify is an AWS service that provides excellent integration with the rest of AWS. The Hugo hosting setup for Cloudflare, AWS Amplify, and Vercel is similar to Netlify, and one cannot go wrong in choosing any of these providers.
